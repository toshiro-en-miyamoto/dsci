# Journey from Statistics to Machine Learning

## Statistics

Statistics is the branch of mathematics, mainly classified into two subbranches:

- *Descriptive statistics*: used to summarize data, such as
  - the *mean*, *standard deviation* for continuous data types (such as age), whereas 
  - frequency and percentage are useful for categorical data (such as gender).
- *Inferential statistics*: Inferences are drawn using
  - *hypothesis testing*,
  - the estimation of numerical characteristics,
  - the *correlation* of relationships within data, and so on.

Many times, a collection of the entire data (also known as *population* in statistical methodology) is impossible, hence a subset of the data points is collected, also called a *sample*, and conclusions about the entire population will be drawn, which is known as inferential statistics.

*Statistical modeling* is applying statistics on data to find underlying hidden relationships by analyzing the significance of the variables.

## Machine Learning

Machine learning is the branch of computer science that utilizes past experience to learn from and use its knowledge to make future decisions.
The goal of machine learning is to generalize a detectable pattern or to create an unknown rule from given examples.

Machine learning is broadly classified into three categories:

- Supervised learning
  - Classification problem
  - Regression problem
- Unsupervised learning
  - Dimensionality reduction
  - Clustering
- Reinforcement learning

Supervised learning is teaching machines to learn the relationship between other variables and a target variable. In unsupervised learning, algorithms learn by themselves without any supervision or without any target variable provided. It is a question of finding hidden patterns and relations in the given data.

Reinforcement learning allows the machine or agent to learn its behavior based on feedback from the environment. In reinforcement learning, the agent takes a series of decisive actions without supervision and, in the end, a reward will be given, either +1 or -1. Based on the final payoff/reward, the agent reevaluates its paths.

In some artificial intelligence applications, supervised learning combined with reinforcement learning could be utilized for solving a problem; an example is self-driving cars in which, initially, images are converted to some numeric format using supervised learning and combined with driving actions (left, forward, right, and backward).

## Model Building and Validation

**Statistical models** are a class of mathematical models that are usually specified by mathematical equations that relate one or more variables to approximate reality. Assumptions embodied by statistical models describe a set of *probability distributions*, which distinguishes it from non-statistical, mathematical, or machine learning models.
